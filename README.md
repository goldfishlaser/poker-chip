# poker-chip
Use this repository to produce a maker chip that is shaped and designed like a poker chip and has your logo on one side and a QR code on the other. 
You will need:
    • Two contrasting colors of filament 
    • OpenSCAD software
    • Inkscape software (for editing SVGs, if needed)

## Example    

<img width="1049" height="1140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d49ca72-e3bd-44c4-83aa-636dc81e60a8" />

<img width="609" height="379" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/709a25ae-7d45-418d-92aa-f2ce4b87193f" />

## About this repository
The images folder contains example SVG files. You will need to replace these with your own files to produce your custom chip. 
The scad folder contains the scad file which you will use to create the STL.
